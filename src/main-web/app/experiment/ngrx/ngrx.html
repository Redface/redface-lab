    <p>First time I've experienced Redux is early of this year. I had to take a part in a new project which is based on
      React/Redux.</p>
    <p>I'm an Angular user, and it was my sort of a huge challenge to adopt React based skills. Data management like
      Redux
      or Flux wasn't that necessary when using Angular for me, because RxJS with Observable was good enough to manage
      data
      changing frequently and communicating in-between components.</p>
    <p>But while doing the new project with React/Redux, I realized separating concerns is really helpful to manage a
      lot
      of data and events. Then I looked back at my previous projects and found high complexity and coupling between
      components and services.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ngrx">Ngrx</a> project is reactive extensions for Angular and one of
      this project is
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ngrx/store">ngrx/store</a> which is state management
      for Angular inspired by Redux.</p>
